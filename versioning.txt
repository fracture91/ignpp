Chrome extension versions look like this:
major.minor.maint.build

Correspondence of build with alphanumeric FF version:
	1000x = ax
	2000x = bx
	3000x = prex
	4000x = rcx
	50000 = final release
	
Build must include "leading" zeros where necessary.

You can't do something like 2.1.0a1 in Chrome.  Must use only integers <65536 and >-1.

Examples:

2.1.0a3 -> 2.1.0.10003
2.1.0b1 -> 2.1.0.20001
3.0.1a27 -> 3.0.1.10027
2.1.0 -> 2.1.0.50001

This means you can have up to 9999 builds for each milestone.

Yes, I could have divided 65534 up into sections of 16383 for each milestone,
and reserved 65535 for the final release, but this is much clearer.
I don't think I'll ever reach 9999 builds for one milestone, anyway.
