IGN++ is a free Firefox and Chrome extension which makes life easier on
boards.ign.com.  It includes features such as: 

Post replies, topics, edits, and send PMs without leaving the page
A WYSIWYG editor with which you can quote multiple posts
Autorefresh - you can see new posts and edits as they're made
Usercolors - you can apply a custom style to your username visible to others
Ignoring Users - selected users' posts are hidden from view
AutoWUL - WUL or deWUL multiple users without leaving the page
and much more...

IGN++ has been in development since May 2009 (then a Greasemonkey script called
Vesti Tools).  This extension was created by the IGN user gamerX1011.  IGN++
was inspired by IGNBQ, an earlier extension by heyf00L.  The current version
number and supported browser versions can be found in install.rdf (Firefox) and
manifest.json (Chrome).


INSTALLATION

The extension can be installed on Firefox via AMO:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ign/

Or on Chrome via the Chrome Web Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neccigeidlomkjogomjkjpeapgojbodn

Most users should install the extension from the above sites.
Installing in this way should provide you with automatic updates.
See install.rdf and manifest.json for information about supported versions, etc

You can find all versions, public and beta, at http://vestitools.pbworks.com
Installing the extension from there may not allow you to receive updates.
You can also find documentation and changelogs there.

AMO lists all IGN++ versions here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ign/versions/

Firefox users can install the extension from the Development Channel to get
updates as soon as I release them.  The Chrome Web Store does not support a
Development Channel, so those Chrome users who want to use a dev version must
download a version from one of the sources above, extract the archive, and
install as an unpacked extension.

This extension was made in such a way that there is one extension archive
file that works on both browsers.  You can extract the archive into a directory
and point both browsers to it, and it will work.
